    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "<p>This tutorial is intended to be a walkthrough of the foundations of an analysis implemented in Coffea (specifically, single top-Higgs production, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.092005\">https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.092005</a>). We will go through data selection using a columnar representation, go over some edge cases to that representation, and plot some relevant data. At the end, we will wrap everything together and demonstrate how Coffea can be easily deployed for scaling an analysis up. This is also a prime opportunity to show off a prototype analysis facility being developed by the coffea-casa team, which was also presented at PyHEP 2020 by Oksana Shadura (\"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDIFd1gDbSc\">YouTube: A prototype U.S. CMS analysis facility</a>\").</p>\n",

A <a href=\"https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/notebooks/nanoevents.html\">NanoEvents tutorial</a> is available which gives a detailed description, but I will give a quick exploration of how it can be used to access data.</p>"
